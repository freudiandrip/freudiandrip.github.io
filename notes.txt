I am a writer, data visualization designer, and programmer currently based in New York City. I attended Columbia's Graduate School of Journalism and hold a BSc. in Biology, minoring in Math from the University of Waterloo. I have taken on a wide range of roles, having previously worked as a UX consultant for early-stage start-ups, bioinformatics researcher, data scientist, developer, and technical writer. As a <a href="https://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/podcast/knowledge-at-wharton-podcast/generalists-vs-specialists/" target="blank">generalist</a>, I favor <a href="https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/article/a-simple-introduction-to-lean-ux#the_minimum_viable_product_and_lean_ux-3" target="blank">lean</a> but <a href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/The_Pragmatic_Programmer" target="blank">pragmatic</a> approaches â€” I like to experiment with different design and tech stacks (but that's not to say I don't play favorites).
